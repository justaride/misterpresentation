# Refined Grit Deck (`refined-grit-deck`)

A tactile, human, print-adjacent deck aesthetic:

- Grain/noise overlay
- Halftone dots
- Slight "misregistration" shadows
- Warm paper base + ink accents

## Goals

- Make the deck feel made, not generated.
- Keep text readability first (contrast + spacing).
- No heavy image assets required (CSS/SVG patterns).

## Interaction

- ArrowLeft/ArrowRight navigation
- On-screen buttons

## Acceptance Criteria

- At least 10 slides with 2-3 layout archetypes (title, two-column, callout).
- Visual system includes grain + halftone + misregistration.
- Playwright test: renders and can navigate.
