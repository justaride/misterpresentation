# Pirates of the Fjord Crown

## Logline

When outlaw captain Soren steals a map to runestones that can bend the wind, Viking jarls turn the fjords into a war zone. To survive, Soren must build an unruly fleet, decide what to do with power that rewrites the sea itself, and choose whether love is an anchor or a sail.

## Core Themes

- **Freedom vs. Law:** outlaw codes, jarl decrees, and the price of "order"
- **Chosen Crew:** loyalty earned through hunger, risk, and mercy
- **Power Has a Cost:** every rune used leaves a debt in weather, blood, or trust
- **Love Under Pressure:** survival-driven intimacy, not destiny romance

## The World

The North is a chain of fjords where trade routes are narrow, weather is weaponized, and reputation travels faster than ships.

- **Norland:** icy harbors and black-market piers. The place that made Soren, and the place that wants him dead.
- **Iron Fjord:** a chokepoint ruled by jarls; longships can seal the channel in an hour.
- **The Wildlands:** pine forests, frozen lakes, hidden coves. Survival isn't a minigame; it is the economy.
- **The Runestone Sites:** ancient markers wedged into cliffs and shoals. They don't "cast spells"; they **bias wind and current** in rules you can learn, exploit, or break.

## Factions

- **The Black Cat Fleet (Outlaws):** smugglers, deserters, debtors, and the crew you assemble. Strong together, vicious when divided.
- **The Jarls of Iron Fjord:** warbands who treat the sea like territory. They don't want treasure; they want control.
- **The Crow Guild:** traders and information brokers who sell routes, names, and betrayals.
- **The Rune-Keepers:** oathbound custodians of runestone lore. Some want the stones buried; others want a crown.

## Main Cast

- **Captain Soren ("Black Cat")**: charismatic, pragmatic, allergic to obedience. His gift is turning desperate people into a plan.
- **Astrid**: Viking navigator with a soldier's discipline and a cartographer's patience. She knows the hidden coves because she once hunted them.
- **Jarl Eirik Ironhook**: the face of the Iron Fjord jarls. He wages war like a blockade: slow, inevitable, suffocating.
- **Ragna Frostjaw**: a rival pirate captain who believes the only stable law is fear. She offers alliance when it benefits her, not a moment sooner.
- **Edda Skald-Runner**: a runaway skald who can turn rumor into leverage. She writes the North's memory in exchange for survival.
- **Hjalmar of the Stones**: a Rune-Keeper exile who teaches Soren the "cost rules" of rune-winds. He isn't a mentor; he's a warning.

## Campaign Outline (4 Acts)

### Act I (Chapter 01): The Black Cat Sets Sail

**Premise:** Norland squeezes outlaws until they become monsters. Soren chooses to become a fleet instead.

- **Main Missions**
  - **The Harbor Debt:** settle a blood-debt to the Crow Guild (pay, steal, or bargain).
  - **Crew of Misfits:** recruit three specialists (combat, navigation, leverage). Each recruitment forces a moral compromise.
  - **The Map With No North:** steal a fragment-map pointing to runestones that "tilt" wind through fjord narrows.
- **Key Choice Points**
  - Recruit by **mercy** (free prisoners) or **fear** (blackmail). This affects late-game unity.
  - Give the Crow Guild **a cut** (future support) or **a knife** (future vendetta).
- **Act End Beat**
  - The Black Cat escapes Norland with the map fragment, and the jarls learn Soren's name.

### Act II (Chapter 02): Raid at Iron Fjord

**Premise:** The jarls clamp down on the sea. Soren must break the clamp without being crushed.

- **Main Missions**
  - **Runestone Trial:** recover the first runestone shard from a cliff-cave at low tide; learn the "rule" that rune-wind must be paid for.
  - **The Channel Seal:** longships block Iron Fjord; Soren plans a raid that is half naval battle, half boarding chaos.
  - **The War Horn Timer:** a set-piece where every minute tightens the noose, pushing aggressive play and clever routing.
- **Key Choice Points**
  - Save captured crew or seize the jarl's war chest (affects resources vs loyalty).
  - Use the rune-wind openly (terror) or subtly (mystery), changing how factions perceive you.
- **Act End Beat**
  - Iron Fjord burns. The jarls declare a blood oath. Ragna Frostjaw offers a poisoned "alliance."

### Act III (Chapter 03): Through Pine and Frost

**Premise:** Victory scatters the crew. The wilderness becomes the arena. Trust becomes the weapon.

- **Main Missions**
  - **Winter Salvage:** rebuild from wreckage, hunt, and scavenge while jarls patrol the coastline.
  - **Astrid's Bargain:** Soren spares Astrid after an ambush. She offers routes through hidden coves, but demands a future she can live with.
  - **The Rune-Keeper Exile:** Hjalmar teaches rune-wind costs, revealing that "winning every fight" is how the sea kills you.
- **Key Choice Points**
  - Treat Astrid as **hostage** (power now) or **partner** (power later). This defines the romance path and the "Sea Law" ending.
  - Backstab Ragna (remove threat) or court her crew (increase unity, increase risk).
- **Act End Beat**
  - Soren and Astrid cross the wildlands to the last map fragment. The runestone altar location is revealed: the Three Fjords.

### Act IV (Chapter 04): War on the Three Fjords

**Premise:** The final war is fought across sea, beach, and ravine. The altar is not a "boss room." It is a constitution.

- **Main Missions**
  - **Fjord-by-Fjord Assault:** three battlefronts (naval, shore, cliff) where earlier allies determine which fronts are survivable.
  - **The Altar of Wind:** a final set-piece: rune-wind can win the war, but each use breaks something permanent.
  - **The Crown Decision:** the last sequence is a choice cascade, not a single button.
- **Key Choice Points**
  - Unite rival crews, betray the jarls, or forge a new sea law with Astrid.
  - Destroy the runestones entirely (if you've learned restraint and kept enough allies alive to escape the vacuum).
- **Act End Beat**
  - The fjords remember your name, but not always as you intended.

## Choice Tracking (Design Handle)

These "variables" are narrative levers the game can surface through dialogue, faction reactions, and availability of endings:

- **Unity:** crew loyalty and faction alignment (high = coalition, low = mutiny risk).
- **Mercy:** whether you spare enemies and protect civilians (high = allies, low = fear).
- **Rune Restraint:** frequency of rune-wind use and willingness to pay its costs (high restraint unlocks "Break the Runes" path).
- **Astrid Trust:** hostage vs partner decisions; whether you honor her lines-in-the-ice.

## Endings (3+)

### 1) Unite the Crews (Coalition Ending)

**Unlock:** high Unity; you recruited by mercy more than fear; you didn't abandon your own during Iron Fjord.

Soren becomes the "first captain" of a fleet that functions like a parliament of knives. The jarls lose the fjords not to conquest, but to a new balance: pirates who finally learned to govern themselves.

### 2) Betray the Jarls (Vengeance Ending)

**Unlock:** high Cunning; you took resources over loyalty; you exploited Ragna and the Crow Guild without breaking.

Soren wins by turning jarl against jarl. The fjords quiet down, but it is the quiet after a storm: trade resumes, fear remains, and Soren is remembered as a shadow that solved problems permanently.

### 3) Forge the Sea Law (Astrid Ending)

**Unlock:** high Astrid Trust; you used rune-wind with restraint; you chose partnership over domination.

Soren and Astrid rewrite the rules of passage: safe coves, protected routes, and a code that binds pirates and Vikings to something like honor. The North doesn't become "good." It becomes **possible**.

### Optional 4) Break the Runes (Vanishing Ending)

**Unlock:** high Mercy; high Rune Restraint; you kept key allies alive to survive the political vacuum.

Soren destroys the runestones at the altar and disappears into the wildlands. The fjords become dangerous again, but honest: no one can own the wind.

## Sample Scenes (Optional Script Seeds)

### Opening Cutscene Beat

Norland's harbor ice cracks like a warning. Soren walks a pier lined with debt notices and knives. The Crow Guild smiles like a ledger. A map fragment changes hands, and suddenly everyone is late to a war.

### Astrid's Turning Point Beat

Astrid stands over a fire with a blade in her lap, not pointing it at Soren, not hiding it either. She explains the difference between a route and a home. Soren learns that you can capture a navigator, but you can't capture a horizon.
