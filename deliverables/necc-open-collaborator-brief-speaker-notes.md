# NECC Partner Brief Speaker Notes

## Deck Meta
- Audience: Potential strategic and technical collaborators.
- Duration target: 7-8 minutes.
- Language: English.
- Positioning: Strategic context + project inspiration + open dialogue.

## Slide 1 - NECC Cover (0:00-0:45)
- Open with one sentence: "NECC is the market accelerator for circular construction collaboration in the Nordics."
- Set expectation: this is a short briefing on why now, what we are building, how it works, and what difference this project could create.
- Keep collaborator framing open and inclusive.

## Slide 2 - Why This Matters Now (0:45-1:45)
- Frame the gap: circular ambition exists, but execution is fragmented across buyers, suppliers, rules, and financing.
- Use the three anchor numbers:
  - Policy direction points to 23-24% circularity level in construction by 2030.
  - Current Nordic baseline is around 5-8%.
  - Technical project potential is much higher (50-95% depending on project type).
- Close with urgency: this is the timing window to build practical infrastructure that helps circular options become default choices.

## Slide 3 - 2030 Outcome (1:45-2:35)
- Explain that NECC is not only a catalog; it is an outcome platform with measurable vectors:
  - Demand side: double circular ambition in real projects.
  - Supply side: 50 companies scaling turnover across Nordic borders.
  - Ecosystem side: stronger alignment between market actors.
  - Policy side: stronger Nordic alignment around circular ambition.
- Keep the message practical: success is measured in real project decisions, not only in awareness.

## Slide 4 - Platform Blueprint (2:35-3:45)
- Walk the three-layer model:
  - Demand layer: property owners, clients, public procurement, ESG-pressured buyers.
  - Core platform: catalog + AI search + funding + regulation + value-chain intelligence.
  - Supply layer: circular products and services already mapped and expandable.
- Emphasize the decision criteria triangle: affordability, availability, profitability.
- State why this matters: if one criterion fails, adoption fails.
- Explicitly anchor credibility: this project builds on pre-project and proof-of-concept work from `Public Circular Buildings`.

## Slide 5 - User Journey (3:45-4:35)
- Narrate the concrete scenario quickly from brief to matchmaking.
- Highlight practical outputs per step:
  - Better candidate fit.
  - Faster compliance clarity.
  - Funding path visibility.
  - Clear next action for buyer and supplier.
- One line: NECC turns fragmented advisory effort into repeatable, confidence-building workflow.

## Slide 6 - Technical Execution Confidence (4:35-5:45)
- Show phased approach:
  - Foundation.
  - Integrations.
  - AI and advanced features.
  - Scale and optimization.
- Mention key decision gates (pilot recruitment, catalog readiness, first paying users, scaling trigger).
- Use credibility proof points briefly:
  - Public Circular Buildings pre-project platform already established.
  - 80 documented public circular building projects.
  - 48 detailed case studies with quantified circularity/material evidence.
  - 5 Nordic countries covered in the current knowledge base.
- Close this slide with risk posture: phased rollout keeps scope and delivery risk controlled.

## Slide 7 - Ecosystem and Partner Roles (5:45-6:45)
- Clarify current anchors:
  - Nordic Circular Hotspot (project owner).
  - Natural State (host + technical platform lead).
  - Existing ecosystem partners.
- Clarify open contribution space:
  - Strategic input.
  - Technical input.
  - Dissemination and implementation support.
- Stress openness: role and scope should be co-defined through dialogue.

## Slide 8 - Impact and Call to Action (6:45-7:30)
- Summarize success in one line: circular sourcing becomes operational at Nordic scale.
- Emphasize impact potential:
  - Better real-world uptake of circular choices.
  - Stronger Nordic coordination.
  - Practical pathways from ambition to implementation.
- Close with open ask: continue dialogue about potential place and contribution in the project.

## Optional 30-Second Q&A Bridge
- If asked "Why this team?": point to proven delivery and domain context.
- If asked "Why now?": point to policy timing and implementation urgency.
- If asked "What role are you offering?": answer that role is open and should be shaped collaboratively.
