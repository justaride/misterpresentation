# Workshop: Storytelling For Product Teams

## Today’s Goal

By the end of this workshop, each team will have a 60-second story and a 6-slide outline for their next initiative.

^ Set expectations. This is not a lecture; it's practice. If the group is mixed, emphasize that the outputs can be rough but must be real.

---

## Working Agreements

- Be kind, be direct
- Timebox everything
- Make the implicit explicit

^ These rules keep the workshop moving. If you have a loud group, add "one mic" verbally rather than on the slide.

---

## Agenda (75 Minutes)

- 10: Setup + examples
- 15: Exercise 1 (problem clarity)
- 20: Exercise 2 (narrative frame)
- 20: Exercise 3 (60-second pitch)
- 10: Debrief + next steps

^ Read the agenda once, then move on. The rest of the deck should be prompts, not content.

---

## Exercise 1: The Problem In One Breath (5 min)

Write:

- Who is struggling?
- What are they trying to do?
- What’s in the way?

^ Solo for 2 minutes, then pair-share for 3. Make people write first; talking without writing leads to vague statements.

---

## Share-Out Format (5 min)

In pairs:

1. Read it verbatim
2. Ask one clarifying question
3. Suggest one sharper noun or verb

^ Keep it lightweight. The goal is not perfection; it's specificity. Encourage replacing abstract words like "optimize" with concrete verbs.

---

## Mini-Lesson: 3 Narrative Frames (5 min)

- Before/After/Bridge
- Problem/Approach/Impact
- Tension/Choice/Consequence

^ Give a 30-second example for each. Ask the group which frame fits their initiative best, then immediately move into the next exercise.

---

## Exercise 2: Pick A Frame (10 min)

Choose one frame and draft 6 bullets:

1. Context
2. Problem
3. Stakes
4. Approach
5. Proof
6. Next step

^ Timebox hard. If someone gets stuck, tell them to write placeholders in brackets and keep moving.

---

## Break (5 min)

Return with:

- One sentence you’re proud of
- One sentence you don’t believe yet

^ This primes honesty. The "don’t believe yet" line is where real product risks usually live.

---

## Exercise 3: 60-Second Pitch (15 min)

Deliver to a partner:

- 45 seconds: the story
- 15 seconds: the ask

^ Coach for clarity and pacing. Encourage stopping early rather than filling time. Remind them: the ask is not "thoughts?" but a concrete next step.

---

## Debrief + Next Steps (10 min)

- What changed in your story after speaking it?
- What question did you get most often?
- What will you test next week?

^ Close with commitments. Ask each group to write one follow-up action: "We will test X with Y people by Z date."
