# Investor Pitch: Clearbox

## One Sentence

Clearbox helps teams get to decisions faster by turning messy meeting inputs into crisp, shareable outcomes.

^ Open with the before/after in plain language. This is not the product spec; it's the feeling: fewer follow-ups, clearer ownership, less rehashing.

---

## The Pain

- Decisions get made twice: once in the room, again in the inbox.
- Action items decay within 48 hours.
- "Who owns this?" becomes a weekly ritual.

^ Make it vivid with a specific anecdote. Keep it general enough to be broadly true without claiming proprietary research.

---

## The Cost

- Lost context compounds.
- Misalignment becomes rework.
- Leaders become human routers.

^ Emphasize that the cost is mostly hidden. If they ask for dollars, you can say you'll quantify per-customer during discovery.

---

## Why Now

- Every team now has more meetings and more tools.
- AI can summarize, but summaries are not decisions.
- The gap is "outcome clarity," not "note volume."

^ Position this as a workflow problem, not a model problem. The wedge is owning the decision artifact that survives the meeting.

---

## The Product

Clearbox captures:

- Decision
- Owner
- Deadline
- Rationale

^ Explain that this is a canonical object. The product is a system for outcome capture and distribution, not just transcription.

---

## How It Works

1. Ingest: calendar + agenda + key docs
2. Assist: prompt participants at the right moments
3. Publish: send a decision page to the systems of record

^ Keep the mechanics high-level. Avoid naming integrations unless you actually have them; you can say "calendar and docs" generically.

---

## Differentiation

- Notes tools store text.
- Project tools store tasks.
- Clearbox stores outcomes and the reasoning behind them.

^ This slide works best when you contrast what teams do today: paste notes into tasks and hope it stays coherent.

---

## Market (Narrative)

Start where decisions are expensive:

- Product launches
- Customer escalations
- Incident reviews
- Weekly leadership syncs

^ Avoid invented TAM numbers. Tell a story: start with the highest-stakes meeting types and expand later.

---

## Traction (No Fake Numbers)

- Design partners: [insert count]
- Weekly active teams: [insert count]
- Time-to-decision improvement: [insert evidence]

^ Use placeholders intentionally. If presenting without data, replace with "early signals" and qualitative quotes.

---

## Go-To-Market

- ICP: teams with recurring cross-functional decisions
- Wedge: decision capture for 1 meeting type
- Expansion: decision pages become the operating system

^ The key is sequencing. A single meeting type becomes the beachhead; then you expand across the organization's decision surface area.

---

## The Ask

- Raising: [amount] for [runway]
- To build: [2-3 product milestones]
- To learn: [2-3 go-to-market hypotheses]

^ Close with clarity. If you don't want to show amounts yet, make the ask "introductions to 5 design partners" and say you're fundraising shortly.
