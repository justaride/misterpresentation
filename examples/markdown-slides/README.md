# Markdown Slide Examples (Deckset)

These are Deckset-compatible slide decks written in Markdown.

## Conventions

- Slide breaks use `---` on its own line.
- Speaker notes use Deckset's `^ ` prefix and appear at the end of each slide.
- No images are referenced (this repo does not currently ship a shared image library for Deckset).
- Frontmatter:
  - `slidenumbers: true`
  - `autoscale: true`

## How To Use

1. Open any `.md` file in Deckset.
2. Present as-is, or copy the file and replace names/nouns with your own content.

## Authoring Checklist

- One clear idea per slide.
- Keep on-slide text scannable; move detail into speaker notes.
- Avoid inventing metrics. Use explicit placeholders where real numbers are required.
- Keep slide titles consistent and descriptive.
