# Client Proposal: 30-Day Pilot

## Outcome

In 30 days, we will ship a working pilot and a decision on whether to scale it.

^ This is a proposal deck, not a pitch. Lead with a measurable decision outcome, even if the pilot's exact metrics are TBD.

---

## What We Heard

- "We can't tell what's working until the quarter is over."
- "Alerts are noisy, but we still miss the real issues."
- "Every team has their own dashboard."

^ Keep these as paraphrases, not quotes, unless you have explicit permission. The goal is to demonstrate listening and alignment.

---

## Success Criteria

- One shared definition of the top 5 KPIs
- A dashboard that updates without manual work
- A weekly review ritual with clear actions

^ Tie each criterion to a business outcome. Ask the client to edit these live if possible; it increases ownership and reduces scope drift.

---

## Scope (In)

- KPI selection workshop (90 minutes)
- Data mapping for agreed sources
- Pilot dashboard for 1 team
- Alerting for 2 critical thresholds

^ Keep the scope concrete and countable. This slide prevents the "while you're in there..." expansion that kills pilots.

---

## Scope (Out)

- Company-wide rollout
- Custom data warehouse redesign
- ML forecasting / anomaly detection
- BI tool migration

^ This is where you earn trust by saying no. Explain that out-of-scope items can be phase 2 if the pilot proves value.

---

## 30-Day Plan

- Week 1: Align and instrument
- Week 2: Build v1 and validate data
- Week 3: Iterate with real users
- Week 4: Operate the ritual and decide

^ Make the timeline feel executable. Mention that the plan assumes quick access to data owners and 2 feedback sessions per week.

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

- You: data access, SME feedback, weekly review attendance
- Us: build, QA, documentation, enablement
- Shared: definition of "done" and change control

^ Keep it simple. If the client is larger, offer to add a RACI appendix later, but don't drown the deck in governance.

---

## Risks & Mitigations

- Data access delays: pre-book owners in Week 0
- KPI debates: timebox and use "decision owner"
- Low adoption: design with the weekly ritual first

^ Frame this as an adult conversation. You are demonstrating you have done this before and know where pilots fail.

---

## Commercials (Pilot)

- Fixed pilot fee: [insert]
- Optional support: [insert]
- Rollout credit if you scale: [insert]

^ Don't invent pricing. If you're not ready to share numbers, replace this slide with "Commercials: included in the follow-up email."

---

## Next Step

1. Confirm success criteria (today)
2. Sign pilot SOW (this week)
3. Kickoff (date)

^ Close with a clear request. If the room is hesitant, propose a 20-minute "scope lock" call to finalize criteria and stakeholders.
