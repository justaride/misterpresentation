## Slide Breakdown

## Slide 1 – Be The First

**Purpose:** Hook early adopters with a clear program name and a concrete promise.

**Content:**

**Kicker (Top-left, mono sticker):**
"EARLY ADOPTER CLIENT DECK"

**Headline (Center-left, huge):**
"BE THE FIRST"

**Subheading (Below headline, medium):**
"Turn product truth into a deck that sells itself."

**Footer (Bottom-left, mono):**
"A pilot-ready template for teams who ship fast."

**Layout:**
- Kicker: top-left, small “sticker” label.
- Headline: mid-left, dominant.
- Subheading: directly below headline, max-width ~42ch.
- Footer: bottom-left.
- Visual: right side, abstract “signal” illustration (see Visual).

**Typography:**

- Subheading: `var(--font-body)`, 20–28pt equivalent.
- Kicker/Footer: `var(--font-mono)`, 10–12pt equivalent, uppercase tracking.

**Visual:**
An abstract “signal” composed of 3 thick lines rising diagonally (like a growth chart), with a lime bloom behind the peak. Lines are ink-colored with subtle noise. The visual suggests momentum without implying specific numbers.

**Transition from previous slide:**
Fade up from paper background with a fast headline pop (scale 0.98 → 1).

## Slide 2 – The Last-Mile Story Problem

**Purpose:** Make the pain concrete in a way early adopters recognize.

**Content:**

**Headline:**
"YOUR STORY BREAKS AT THE LAST MILE"

**Bullets (exact text):**
- "The deck you shipped last month is already stale."
- "Every update requires design time and a new export."
- "Interactive demos live somewhere else, not in the narrative."
- "Sales decks drift. Product decks drift. Everyone drifts."

**Callout (sticker, right side):**
"THIS IS FIXABLE."

**Layout:**

**Visual:**
A simple “broken handoff” diagram: three rectangles labeled "Product", "Design", "Sales" with arrows that misalign. Use ink lines with one lime highlight on the misalignment point.

**Transition from previous slide:**
Hard cut with a subtle “paper snap” (quick opacity + y shift).

## Slide 3 – The New Approach

**Purpose:** Reframe from “a deck” to “a deck system.”

**Content:**

**Headline:**
"BUILD A DECK SYSTEM, NOT A DECK FILE"

"Early adopters win by shipping the narrative as fast as the product."

**Layout:**
- Headline: top-left.
- Pillars: three large tiles across the center (or stacked on mobile).
- Subheading: bottom-left.

**Typography:**
- Pillar labels: display for the key phrase, body for supporting line if needed.
